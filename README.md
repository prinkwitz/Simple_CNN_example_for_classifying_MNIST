# Simple_CNN_example_for_classifying_MNIST
This example for a simple CNN is intended as a showcase for how to use Keras and Deep Learning to classify data. It can be used to create visualizations throughout the data preprocessing steps, training (Tensorboard) and evaluation.
You can either use the Python script or the Jupyter Notebook. The Code is the same. Both use Keras as API for training CNNs.
